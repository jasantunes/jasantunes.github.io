I am an Engineering Leader with {{total_yoe}}+ YoE in professional software development and 4+ YoE of managing teams of software engineers. I've worked at some of the top-tier tech companies both as an Engineering Manager and as Software Engineer, and also headed the Department of Engineering of a Series C startup.

I have a track record of building core customer-facing products, operating high-scale distributed systems, and developing high-performing teams.

I have a strong background in backend and distributed systems, including a PhD in Network Security with 7+ YoE in distributed systems research and in pan-european sponsored projects, and I am the author of several international research papers, patents in network performance monitoring and search relevancy, and two books on network attack injection.
