I am an Engineering Leader with almost {{total_yoe}}+ YoE in professional software development and {{management_yoe}}+ YoE of managing teams of software engineers. I previously held the title of Head of Engineering of a Series C startup, where at one point I was managing up to 20 engineers, including engineering managers, software engineers, data scientists and SREs.

I have a track record of building core customer-facing products, operating high-scale distributed systems, and developing high-performing teams.

I have a strong background in backend and distributed systems, including a PhD in Network Security with 7+ YoE in distributed systems research and in pan-european sponsored projects, and I am the author of several international research papers, patents in network performance monitoring and search relevancy, and two books on network attack injection.
