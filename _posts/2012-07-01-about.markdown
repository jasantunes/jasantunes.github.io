I am a Director of Engineering with a strong technical background in backend and network monitoring R&D. I also hold a PhD in network security and dependability of network systems.

I have over seven years of experience in pan-european research projects, and I am the author of several international research papers, patents in network performance monitoring and search relevancy, and two books on network attack injection.

I left academia {{years_since_arriving}} years ago to work at startups in Silicon Valley.
For the past six years I have been working with a broad full stack technology at exciting SaaS startups in San Francisco, CA, namely C++, Ruby (Rails), Python, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Amazon AWS, Redis, MySql, Postgres, Kafka, Docker, etc.
