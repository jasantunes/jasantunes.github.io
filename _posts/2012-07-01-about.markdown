![Joao Antunes](img/me.jpg){:class="img-responsive img-circle"}

I am software engineer with a PhD in security and dependability of network systems and over seven years of experience in pan-european research projects. I am the author of several international research papers, two patents in network performance monitoring (one pending approval), and two books on network attack injection.

For the past five years I have been working with a broad full stack technology stack at exciting SaaS startups in San Francisco, CA, namely C++, Ruby, Python, Rails, Redis, Elasticsearch, MySql, Postgres, Kafka, Docker, Amazon AWS, etc.
