  [Entelo](http://www.entelo.com/) is a recruiting platform that applies intelligence to big data to help modern recruiters find, qualify, and acquire talent. We process over 6TB data daily, which poses very interesting challenges, from scalable ingestion of data to building accurate machine learning models. Entelo is a first-class recruiting platform powered by AI with an ever-growing customer base of over 700 customers, including big names such as Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Netflix, Slack, PayPal, Lyft, Asana, among others.

  As **Director of Engineering** I have been responsible for the I&D and Data Science teams to develop and maintain the two main products of Entelo: [Search](https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/) and [Envoy](https://www.entelo.com/products/envoy/).
